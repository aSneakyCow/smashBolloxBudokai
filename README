THREE.js + physijs on node.js
===============================

run physical engine server-side with node.js.

About this project
-------------------
There are 2 sub directories (browser + node). Both apps are the same example. There
is a falling box, that lands on another box. It's just a trivial physical demo.

The libraries in "browser/libs" are original from three/physijs (except the log).
But the libraries in "node/libs" are modified to work with node.js.


Requirements
=============
you need socket.io
> $ npm install -g socket.io
